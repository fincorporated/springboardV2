                        <p >Springboard to Design encourages and mentors high school students from underrepresented populations to explore the process of theatrical collaboration and the many avenues of American Theatre design. Led by renowned members of the contemporary theatre in the heart of NYC, the Springboard to Design curriculum includes workshops, seminars, and access to important work on and off Broadway. Instructors consist of award-winning artists who create a collaborative environment for students, as they explore costume, set, lighting, projection, and sound design.</p>
                        <p>Springboard to Design is an initiative by <a href='https://www.design-action.com/about-us' target='blank' >Design Action,</a>  an intergenerational coalition of BIPOC and white designers working to end racial inequities in North American theatre. The program was incubated in collaboration with the <a href='https://americantheatrewing.org/' target='blank' >American Theatre Wing</a>  in 2021. In the summer of 2025, Springboard to Design was hosted at The Harvey Fierstein Theatre Lab housed in The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts in the heart of Lincoln Center.</p>
                        <p>Springboard to Design was recognized by the 2023 Anthem Awards as a Bronze Winner for Education, Arts, & Culture - Community Engagement.</p>
